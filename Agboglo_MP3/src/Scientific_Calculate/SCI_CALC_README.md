## Scientific Calculator

### Overview

This Java project is a fully functional scientific calculator developed using Java Swing. It is capable of performing both basic arithmetic operations and more complex scientific functions, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.

### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Functions**: Supports trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan), logarithms, exponentials, square root, and more.
- **Memory Operations**: Allows users to clear the display, use backspace, and handle errors gracefully.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes Java Swing to provide a graphical user interface that includes buttons for each numeral and operation.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for common input errors.

### Usage

1. **Starting the Application**: Run the `calc` class. This will open the graphical user interface.
2. **Performing Calculations**: Click on the buttons on the calculator to input operations and numbers.
3. **Switching Modes**: Use the menu options to switch between standard and scientific modes.
4. **Exiting the Application**: Use the 'Exit' button to close the calculator.

### Example Interaction

- **Basic Operations**: Click `1`, `+`, `2`, then `=` to see the result `3`.
- **Scientific Operations**: Click `2`, then `sin` to calculate the sine of 2 radians.
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid input is detected, the calculator will show an error message.

### Code Structure

- **Main Components**:
  - `calc.java`: Contains the main class and methods for calculator operations.
  - `initComponents()`: Initializes the components and layout of the calculator.
  - Event handlers for each button that define calculator operations.

### Conclusion

This scientific calculator project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for building graphical user interfaces and handling user interactions in a desktop application. It covers fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, object-oriented programming, and more complex mathematical functions.
