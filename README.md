## Lexical Analyzer

### Overview

The Lexical Analyzer is a Java implementation designed to translate high-level code into tokens that can be processed by a computer. It is a crucial part of a compiler's front-end, handling the breakdown of input code into lexemes and classifying them into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and operators.

### Key Features

- **Tokenization**: Converts sequences of characters into meaningful tokens.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and reports lexical errors like invalid token constructions.
- **GUI Support**: Allows code input through a graphical user interface for real-time lexical analysis.

### Usage

Run the Lexical Analyzer to input code and receive a breakdown of tokens and any lexical errors. It can be used to understand how compilers interpret code.

## Mower Management System

### Overview

This system manages various types of mowers, handling operations like creation, maintenance records, and availability checks.

### Key Features

- **Different Mower Types**: Supports multiple types of mowers with specific attributes.
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Keeps records of maintenance for each mower.
- **Availability Checks**: Determines if mowers are available for use or need maintenance.

### Usage

Compile and run the system to manage mower inventories and maintenance schedules. Useful for businesses that require meticulous tracking of their equipment.

## Book Management System

### Overview

Manages a collection of books, supporting operations like adding, removing, and searching for books based on different criteria.

### Key Features

- **Cataloging**: Allows for the addition and removal of books.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by author, title, or ISBN.
- **Loan Management**: Tracks which books are loaned out and their due dates.

### Usage

Use the system to maintain a library or personal book collection, with features to manage loans and track inventory.

## Palindrome Checker

### Overview

Determines if a given string is a palindrome, which reads the same backward as forward.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Character Comparison**: Utilizes two pointers to compare characters from both ends of the string.
- **Simple Logic**: Uses a loop to check characters until the middle of the string is reached.

### Usage

Run the `Palindrome` class with a string input to check if it is a palindrome. Outputs "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

## Hotel Reservation System

### Overview

Manages room bookings for a hotel, supporting different types of rooms and handling reservations based on room availability.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Each room type has a different pricing strategy.
- **Reservation Management**: Checks room availability and handles reservations.

### Usage

Interact with the system through a graphical user interface to book rooms based on availability.

## Artist Theater System

### Overview

Manages seat reservations and ticket purchases for theater shows, providing a GUI for easy interaction.

### Key Features

- **Seat Management**: Handles seat reservations and checks for availability.
- **Ticket Purchasing**: Allows users to purchase tickets through a GUI.

### Usage

Run the `TheaterSystemGUI` class to use the system. Users can select show dates, times, and seats to make reservations or purchase tickets.

## Simple Java Calculator

### Overview

A straightforward calculator implemented in Java, designed to help novices learn how to create a calculator program.

### Key Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and easy-to-use graphical interface.

### Usage

Run the executable `Calc.java` to start the calculator and perform basic arithmetic operations.
