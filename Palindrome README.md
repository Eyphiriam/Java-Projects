The provided Java code is a simple program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The code uses two pointers to compare characters from the beginning and the end of the string, moving towards the center.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Class and Method Structure

- **Class Name**: `Palindrome`
- **Method**: `isPalindrome(String str)`
  - **Purpose**: Checks if the input string `str` is a palindrome.
  - **Parameters**: `str` - the string to check.
  - **Returns**: `boolean` - `true` if `str` is a palindrome, `false` otherwise.

### Logic of `isPalindrome` Method

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Two integer pointers are initialized:
   - `i` starts at 0 (beginning of the string).
   - `j` starts at `str.length() - 1` (end of the string).

2. **Comparison Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < j`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are not the same, the function returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.
     - If they are the same, increment `i` and decrement `j` to move the pointers towards the center of the string.

3. **Return Value**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

### Main Method

- **Purpose**: To test the `isPalindrome` method.
- **Process**:
  - A string `str` is defined with the value `"geeks"`.
  - The `isPalindrome` method is called with `str` as the argument.
  - Based on the return value, it prints `"Yes"` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise `"No"`.

### Example Output

For the input `"geeks"`, the output will be `"No"` because "geeks" is not a palindrome. If you change `str` to `"racecar"`, the output would be `"Yes"`.
